[endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date) is an informational website that tracks support cycles and release schedules of over 340 products.

Not all product websites can easily answer the question: "How long is this product supported?".
We track it, and showcase exact dates along with a concise summary of the release policy.
Here's a screenshot of how it looks:

The complete website is open-source, and we are always working to make it better.

We have been doing this since 2019, as a collective effort involving [over 500 contributors](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/graphs/contributors):
